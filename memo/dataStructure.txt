# Let's think about data structure
I will use Firebase to accelerate development\
Here's important things to consider
* Minimize a cost using DBaaS
* Prepare for future updates

# about DBaaS
I will use two DBaaS to save cost
* Firestore
As a main database.
* Realtime Database
Will store recent tasks which is frequently read and wrote
They are only charged the Storage size and the Transfer, not like FireStore
